# Logo Images Directory

Place your logo images in this directory.

## Required Logo Files

Add the following logo image files here:

- `thomas-logo.png` - Logo for Thomas (retail investor)
- `ap-logo.png` - Logo for AP (Authorized Participant)
- `stablecoin-logo.png` - Logo for Stablecoin Provider
- `digital-exchange-logo.png` - Logo for Digital Exchange
- `traditional-exchange-logo.png` - Logo for Traditional Exchanges
- `cdp-logo.png` - Logo for CDP (Central Depository)
- `dcdp-logo.png` - Logo for dCDP (decentralized CDP)
- `settlement-logo.png` - Logo for Settlement (ST)

## Image Requirements

- Format: PNG (recommended) or SVG
- Size: Ideally 48x48px or larger (will be scaled to 24x24px in the visualizer)
- Background: Transparent or white background works best
- The logos will be displayed in the top-left corner of each rectangle node

## Usage

The Network Visualizer will automatically load these logos when you add them to this directory.
If a logo is missing, the rectangle will still display with the stakeholder name, but without the logo icon.
